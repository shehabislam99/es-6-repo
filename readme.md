**simple practice problems**

for you to strengthen your understanding of `map`, `filter`, `forEach`, and `find`.

### üîπ Practice Problems

1. Given an array of numbers, create a new array where each number is doubled. (use **map**)

2. From an array of numbers, get only the even numbers. (use **filter**)

3. From an array of numbers, find the first number that is greater than 50. (use **find**)

4. Given an array of strings (names), print each name with `"Hello, "` in front. (use **forEach**)

5. Given an array of numbers, create a new array of their squares. (use **map**)

6. From an array of ages, return only the ages that are 18 or older. (use **filter**)

7. From an array of numbers, find the first number that is divisible by 7. (use **find**)

8. From an array of words, print the length of each word. (use **forEach**)

9. Given an array of temperatures in Celsius, create a new array with the values converted to Fahrenheit. (use **map**)

10. From an array of products with prices, filter out only the products that cost more than 100. (use **filter**)

## Practice Problem with Array of Objects

I‚Äôll give you tasks + sample arrays when needed. You‚Äôll figure out whether to use `map`, `filter`, `forEach`, or `find` yourself.
